# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will _hopefully_ be documented in this file.

The format is _loosely_ based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project thought about adhering to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) but didn't get very far.
